## Navbar:
Responsive navbar created. When accessed on mobile, the menu items are replaced by burger menu. This was achieved using css styling and javascript

## Image slider
The image slider was built with a combination of html, css and controlled by javascript. 

## Animated numbers
Upon page load, the numbers would animate from 0 to the set number. This was achieved using javascript.

## Lists and Filter views
List of Candidates is generated via API (fetch method) from JSON file. Javascript was used to generate filter options. The list can be filtered by Gender, Political Party, Constituencies and Final Verdit (elected or not elected).

In addition the list can be filtered by alphabetical index. The "Elected" candidates are also highlighted in lightgreen.
